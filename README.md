# Ascent

Ascent is an open-source, scope-enforced, human-in-the-loop AppSec pipeline, written in Rust.

## Invoke, don't vendor

Ascent drives external open-source scanners (subfinder, httpx, katana, nuclei) as subprocesses through a scope-checked runner. They are invoked, never vendored or linked into the Ascent binary.

Triage uses [Crux](https://github.com/Aldiharley/crux), the author's Apache-2.0 triage engine, linked as a library (`crux = { path = "../crux", default-features = false }`). With default features off, Crux's HTTPS client is compiled out, so the Ascent binary contains no network code and triage runs Crux's offline `MockTriager`.

## Building

Crux is a path dependency, so check it out next to Ascent:

```
Projects/
  Ascent/
  crux/
```

Then run `cargo test` in `Ascent/`.
